= Minion with gRPC Strategy

_Minions_ and {page-component-title} can communicate via link:https://grpc.io/[gRPC] for both _RPC_ and _Sink_ patterns.
While using `GRPC` strategy Minion runs a _gRPC_ client that connects to {page-component-title} gRPC server on a custom port.

RPC pattern on GRPC strategy uses bidirectional streaming to send requests from {page-component-title} and get responses back from Minion.
Sink pattern on GRPC strategy uses unidirectional streaming to send sink messages from Minion to {page-component-title}.

This section describes how you can set up {page-component-title} to use `gRPC` for communication with _Minions_.
