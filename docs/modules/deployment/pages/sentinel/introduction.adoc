#TODO: What is Sentinel in a high-level-nutshell#

This section describes how to install the _Sentinel_ to scale individual components.

Currently _Sentinel_ can be used:

* Only allows distribution of _Telemetryd_ functionality (such as processing flows, or use the existing telemetry adapters to store measurements data to _Newts_)
* Requires a _Minion_ to work as a (message) producer
* In most cases, it is advised to disable those adapters and listeners in _{page-component-title}_ if they are also running by a _Sentinel_ instance.

NOTE: At the moment only flows can be distributed using _Sentinel_.
      In the future more components will follow.
