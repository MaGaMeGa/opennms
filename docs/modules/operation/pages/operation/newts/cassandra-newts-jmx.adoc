= Newts Monitoring

This section describes the metrics {page-component-title} collects for monitoring the Newts keyspace from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Keyspace` on an Cassandra node.

TIP: JMX must be enabled on the Cassandra nodes and made accessible from {page-component-title} in order to collect these metrics.
     See link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/configuration/secureJmxAuthentication.html[Enabling JMX authentication] for details.

The data collection is bound to the agent IP interface with the service name JMX-Cassandra-Newts.
The JMXCollector is used to retrieve the MBean entities from the Cassandra node.
