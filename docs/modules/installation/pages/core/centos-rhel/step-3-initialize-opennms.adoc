TIP: If you want to receive SNMP Traps or Syslog messages you have to allow incoming traffic on your host firewall as well.
     By default OpenNMS {page-component-title} SNMP trap daemon is listening on 162/udp and Syslog daemon is listening on 10514/udp.
     The SNMP Trap daemon is enabled by default, the OpenNMS Syslog daemon is disabled.
