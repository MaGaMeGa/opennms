= What's New

== System Requirements

* *Java 8 through 11*: OpenNMS Horizon {page-component-version} runs on JDK 8 through 11.
  We recommend the most recent version of OpenJDK 11.
* *PostgreSQL 10 or higher*: Horizon {page-component-version} requires any supported version of PostgreSQL from 10 up to (and including) 13.

== Breaking Changes

=== Kafka RPC Enables single topic configuration by default.

Enables single topic by default for Kafka RPC which would reduce number of topics on Kafka.
Both Minion and OpenNMS need to be updated to OpenNMS Horizon {page-component-version}.
Make sure that Kafka Lag on Sink topics be minimal before upgrading otherwise there may be loss of those sink messages.
