OpenNMS {page-component-title} is an open source platform that helps you visualize and monitor everything on your network. 
It offers comprehensive fault, performance, traffic monitoring, and alarm generation in one place. 
Highly customizable and scalable, {page-component-title} easily integrates with your core business applications and workflows.

{page-component-title} collects data on the devices, interfaces, and services you define during provisioning. 
It triggers alarms when it detects a problem, and also stores the metrics it collects over a long period of time. 
Not only can you monitor and troubleshoot problems on your network, you can also analyze trends and anticipate problems for better capacity management and network optimization.
